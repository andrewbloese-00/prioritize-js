# Requirements To Run
In order to start this project, node must be installed on your machine. ( it can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en/). ). Make sure you download the LTS version not Current. 

# Once Node is installed 
After your machine has node installed, navigate to the project root directory in a terminal or using gitbash if you are on windows. Then run the command... 

```
 npm install
```

which will install all the neccessary dependencies. After that (in the same directory) run the command... 

```
 npm run start
```

which will start up the development server and open the page in a new browser tab/window. 

** if it does not launch automatically, then open up a browser window and enter "localhost:3000" in the url field. 

### Some notes

* there is a bug with the edit functionality where it doesn't save the task once done editing, however the page can still be navigated to. 
* if you have any questions about how to get the project running please do not hesitate to contact me at abloese@asu.edu
